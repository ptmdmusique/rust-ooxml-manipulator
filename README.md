## Final Project

**Author**: Duc Phan

**Description**

```
A program that extracts a Word file into its [OOXML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML) representation and also provide some utils

The major features of this program includes
* extract a Word file into a new folder containing its OOXML representation
* summarize the structure: how many files, how many images, how many custom XML, etc
* re-zip into the original Word file after the user has modified the file
* allow adding/editing custom XMLs
* validate OOXML structure

The extraction is inspired by this [VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yuenm18.ooxml-viewer)
